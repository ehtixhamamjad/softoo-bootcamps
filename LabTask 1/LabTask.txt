Lab Task:

Title: Manipulating Arrays and Objects in JavaScript

Objective: To apply the concepts of datatypes, arrays, objects, and array methods that were taught in class.

Instructions:

Create an array of 5 student objects, each containing the following properties: name, age, and subject.
Write a function to add a new student object to the end of the array.
Write a function to remove the student object at a specified index.
Write a function to update the subject of a specified student object.
Write a function to create a shallow copy of the array and store it in a new variable.
Write a function to create a deep copy of the array and store it in a new variable.
Use console.log to display the original array, shallow copy, and deep copy.
Note: You can use the Array.prototype.slice method for shallow copying, and JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj)) for deep copying.

Submit the code when you are done.

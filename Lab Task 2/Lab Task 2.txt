Given an array of users, each represented by an object with the following properties:
 {
name: 'John Doe',
age: 35,
email: 'john@doe.com',
address: {
city: 'New York',
state: 'NY'
}
}


1. Use the forEach method to print the name and email of each user.
2. Use the map method to create an array of just the names of each user.
3. Use the optional chaining operator (?.) to safely access the state of each user's
address.
4. Use the rest operator to collect all the remaining properties of each user into a
new object.
5. Use destructuring to extract the name and email of each user into separate
variables
